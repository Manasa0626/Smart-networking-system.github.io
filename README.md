### Hello, I'm Manasa 👋

I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. Here's a glimpse of my work:

## 🛠 Projects
- *Project 1*: Electricity connectio
- electricity connection system can be modeled as a graph problem where nodes represent houses or locations, and edges represent wires or transmission lines connecting them. The goal is to minimize the total cost of connecting all nodes while ensuring all are linked to a power source
- *Project 2*: Gas pipline coonection
- the "gas pipeline connection system" can be modeled as an optimization problem that involves finding the most cost-effective way to connect gas stations or distribution points in a network. The goal is to minimize the cost of constructing pipelines while ensuring all nodes are connected.
## 🚀 Skills
- C++, Python, C
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques
